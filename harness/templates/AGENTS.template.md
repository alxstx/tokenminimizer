## How to work here (operating contract)
- **Read `memory/MEMORY.md` first** every task — it's the live state + index. Do **not** re-scan the whole repo; use the map below and the memory index to find what you need.
- **Load detail on demand:** architecture → `memory/architecture.md`; the "why" behind choices → `memory/decisions.md`; the current plan → `memory/tasks.md`. Open a file when you need it, not pre-emptively.
- **Small, reversible steps.** Make the smallest change that advances the task; prefer several verifiable edits over one sprawling one. Match the surrounding code's style and reuse existing helpers.
- **Stay in scope.** Discover unrelated work? Note it in `memory/tasks.md` and raise it — don't silently expand the change.
- **When genuinely unsure, ask one sharp question** rather than guessing on something expensive to undo.
- **Update memory after meaningful changes** (rules in `memory/MEMORY.md`). Keep the index short; push detail to topic files.
- This repo runs **interactive**: propose a plan and pause for approval before large or irreversible changes.

## Definition of done
A change is done only when:
- [ ] It satisfies the task's goal and stated done-condition.
- [ ] Tests for the affected area pass (`{{TEST_CMD}}`); new behavior has a test.
- [ ] Lint / format is clean (`{{LINT_CMD}}`).
- [ ] `memory/` is updated — the change is logged and any durable lesson filed.
- [ ] For non-trivial changes, `harness/prompts/verify-change.md` returned PASS.

## Stack & commands
<!-- fill: copy real commands verbatim from package scripts / Makefile / justfile / CI. Be exact — these run unattended. -->
- **Languages / frameworks:** {{STACK}}
- **Install:** `{{INSTALL_CMD}}`
- **Build:** `{{BUILD_CMD}}`
- **Test:** `{{TEST_CMD}}`  (single test: `{{TEST_ONE_CMD}}`)
- **Lint / format:** `{{LINT_CMD}}` / `{{FORMAT_CMD}}`
- **Run locally:** `{{RUN_CMD}}`
- **Other:** {{TYPECHECK_/_MIGRATE_/_SEED_/_ETC}}

## Architecture map (where things live)
<!-- fill: one line per top-level dir/module that matters — path → responsibility. This is what lets an agent navigate without re-reading the repo. Deeper detail goes in memory/architecture.md. -->
- `{{path/}}` — {{responsibility}}
- `{{path/}}` — {{responsibility}}

Entry point(s): {{ENTRYPOINTS}}. Request / data flow: {{ONE_LINE_DATA_FLOW}}.

## Conventions
<!-- fill: only non-obvious, enforceable rules — the things a new contributor gets wrong. Concrete > abstract. Add a tiny do/don't only where it prevents a repeated mistake. A rule that applies to just some files belongs in .github/instructions/ instead. -->
- {{CONVENTION — e.g. "Errors: return the shared `AppError`; never throw raw strings."}}
- {{CONVENTION}}

## Boundaries (do not touch without asking)
- {{GENERATED_OR_VENDORED_PATHS}}, {{SECURITY_SENSITIVE_AREAS}}, {{MIGRATIONS}}, {{PUBLIC_API_CONTRACTS}}

## When stuck
- Re-read the relevant `memory/` topic file before re-reading source.
- Check `memory/decisions.md` — the thing you're about to "fix" may be a deliberate choice.
- Blocked after a couple of genuine attempts? Stop and summarize the blocker + your options for the human.
